# Troubleshooting

```
> **I get this `Debug Error!` everytime I close the game, how do I fix?**

![Debug Error](https://github.com/WrekLess/shield-docs/assets/9027113/a61e46b9-8457-4f60-a2b8-fa25ad416ed8)

&#x20;⁠ This is known and expected behavior. There is no fix at this time.

> **I get this `Fatal error_Error code: 402296948` when I try to play the game by clicking `Online` or `Offline`, how do I fix?**

![Crash - Fatal Error](https://github.com/WrekLess/shield-docs/assets/9027113/b2dcdc65-1844-448d-9f64-29998eb9dd80)

&#x20;⁠ The game crashed because you are probably missing files. Try verifying the game files using the Battlenet launcher.

> **I get this `Fatal error_Error code: 140707235801993` when I joined a public lobby on multiplayer and the game crashed, how do I fix?**

![2](https://github.com/WrekLess/shield-docs/assets/9027113/26a52238-c1dc-4d04-819f-4af4c82d81e1)

&#x20;⁠ The game crashed because you are probably missing files. Try verifying the game files using the Battlenet launcher.

> **I get this `ERROR_Connection to the Battle.net servers could not be established. Error code: BLZBNTBGS000003E9` when I try joining a public match.**

![Bnet Error](https://github.com/WrekLess/shield-docs/assets/9027113/5695182a-ae45-4c48-b052-4c2e152fb298)

&#x20;⁠ This is likely due to Windows Defender or your antivirus deleting the d3d11.dll file that the bo4-launcher installs to the root of your bo4 game directory. To resolve this, either add an exception for the file or the game directory to avoid future deletions. Then, restore the file from the Recycle Bin and try again.

> **I get this `ERROR_server script error can't allocate more variables` starting Voyage of the Damned and using BlackOps4_shield_atianmenu in the mods folder, how do I fix?**

![Script Error](https://github.com/WrekLess/shield-docs/assets/9027113/07a8eafa-443d-42f8-9112-0be32063d321)

&#x20;⁠ It’s a common bug, but needs a dev to write a profiler. Solution is to remove the mod. Fix is TBD.
