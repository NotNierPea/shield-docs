# Private Match / Server Faq

> What is this used for?

This is used to host a private server so that trusted people can connect to you. It is managed by a webpanel.

> What Languages Are Supported ?

All the languages the base game supports. (The server will download lpc on player connect)

> Can i play using `radmin` an `zero tier`

Yes. Open Radmin / Zerotier and connect you and yourself to the same network, to play use the server emulator's host ip from Radmin / Zerotier in `project-bo4.json`

> What can't it do? What are the issues?

For now, a few issues are known,

* It can't host multiple instances of the same lobby.

_Example_: you can have one lobby with Blood of the Dead, one lobby with IX, but not 2 lobbies with Blood the dead.

* It can't automatically disband a lobby after use, you need to disband the lobby manually on the webpanel.
* Stats and unlocks dont work properly.
